# pyil
 A IL-inspired pseudo-language created in python


Exactly what it says on the tin

Actual documentation in "runme.pyl"

pyil_main.py is where all the cool stuff happens

Me bad at making good looking and simple code though, so please open an issue if you have a optimization you'd like to share!
